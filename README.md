### Mod 4 Capstone Project

StreetEatz is an app that allows users to find food truck vendors in the area. Food truck owners are also able to join and manage the many different items that they offer to customers. Also allows users to rate and add favorite vendors to their dashboard so they can revisit in the future.

## Purpose

The purpose of the back end for the StreetEatz app is to build APIs and stores the database so that the front end can utilize the data to build the app.

<b><u>Data Management:</u></b>The back end serves as the central hub for storing, organizing, and managing the data associated with user ratings, favorited food trucks, food truck menu items, and food truck information (location, hours, wait time, and a description of what they offer). It provides the necessary infrastructure and databases to efficiently handle the large volume of information generated by the app's food truck vendors.

Overall, the purpose of the back end in the StreetEatz app is to support seamless data management. It plays a vital role in ensuring the app's functionality, enhancing the experience of users searching for available food truck vendors in their area.
